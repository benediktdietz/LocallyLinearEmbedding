## Locally Linear Embedding of MNIST Data using Python

This is an implementation of the algorithm presented in ['An Introduction to Locally Linear Embedding'](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jebara/6772/papers/lleintro.pdf).

### Data

I'm using the well known MNIST data set as input for my implementation. It is loaded through the sklearn API in this case but also publicly available in many other places. 

### Code

The code is written in Python and should be easily runnable by executing the main script.

### Results

Some of the resulting plots
